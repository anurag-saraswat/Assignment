Search Strategy Used: Greedy Search Algorithm

-------------------Greedy Search Algorithm------------------
A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. 
In many problems, a greedy strategy does not usually produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

-----------------------Approach-----------------------------

In this problem we have to arrange 'N' shops in 't' time slots and in 'm' parallel markets where in each market 'k' shops are present such that 'N = t*m*k'

Steps of Algorithm:
 1. Randomly choose first shop from total available shops.
 2. Arrange k shops in first market by greedly choosing shops from available list which maximises the goodness.
 3. Next, Choose shops for subsequent m-1 parallel markets which maximises the goodness i.e maximises similarity among shops of same market and maximises difference among shops of parallel market. 
 4. Repeat 1-3 steps for remaining time slots. 
 
 Extra:
 5. For further getting optimal solution start search with different random initial nodes and store all solutions and return solution which have maximum goodness.
