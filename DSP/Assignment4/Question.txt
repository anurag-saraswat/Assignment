1. There is ZERO tolerance for plagiarism. Please ensure that your codes/algorithms are unique. Do not copy from the internet or your friends. (Copied codes are easily detected and penalized straight away!) 
2. Submit your solutions on SPOJ and share your code / algorithm and SPOJ ID with us using the attached Google form. Please follow the submission format specified in the form. 
3. Even if the code does not pass the test cases on SPOJ, do not worry, partial marking will be awarded as per the solution. (So, please keep your code well-commented.) 
4. Try to keep minimal use of library functions. Complete marks will be awarded for the codes written from scratch. 
5. Please follow the guidelines discussed in the class regarding programming strategies for particular assignment questions. (You may grab some bonus marks from that! )
